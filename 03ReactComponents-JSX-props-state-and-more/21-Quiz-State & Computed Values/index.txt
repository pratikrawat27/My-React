1) What's the purpose of "State" in React apps?
ANS : Its data that, when changed, cause React to re-evaluate a component. 

2) There are two "Rules of Hooks".
Which of the following statements is NOT TRUE according to those rules?
ANS : You must not call React Hooks next to other Hooks.

3)Will the following code work?
import { useState } from 'react';
 
function SomeComponent() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState(false);
 
  function handleClick() {
    const [selected, setSelected] = useState(true);
  }
 
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Select</button>
}
ANS : No, it will throw an error because you can't have multiple hooks inside one functional component.

4) What's the idea behind "derived state" / "computed values"?
ANS : Computed values are values that shouldn't be managed as separate state since they can be derived form other state.
