// Exercise: Working with Functions
// Your task is to write a new function that should be named combine and have the following characteristics:

// Accept three input values

// Calculate a new value based on the three input values: a * b / c (if a, b & c are the input values)

// Return the calculated result

function combine(a,b,c){
    return a * b / c
}

const maths = combine(5,6,7);
console.log(maths)
